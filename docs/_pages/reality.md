With role-playing games, players are encouraged to create fictional characters and make them "come to life" within the game. Part of what makes tabletop RPG's so uniqe (compared to things like video game RPGs), is that while the rules provide a framework for interacting with the game world, all of the characters within the game (including the player characters) are based on real-world principles and inter-personal interactions. 

For example, role playing games let players come to grips with real-world issues such as: personal motivation, interpersonal relationships, and a sense of accomplishment. It also encourages the players to examine deeper personal issues such as depression, addiction, or even debate the purpose of life, all within the safe confines of a fictional universe with fictional characters.

Because of this close tie between the game and reality, RPG Squire acknowledges that playing tabletop RPG's *will* help players become aware of very *real* issues, so we will attempt to provide links or references whenever possible where you can get real-world help for real-world issues.

## Facing Facts
Three universal facts about humanity tie very closely into RPG gameplay:

1. **People are flawed.**
   * No exceptions.
2. **People seek redemption.**
   * There is something within all of us that recognizes our flaws, points them out, and makes us yearn for something better.
   * This fact is the main reason that the "redemption story arc" is one of the most relatable and popular themes in storytelling of all time.
3. **People cannot fix themselves.**
   * It always takes the assistance of at least one another person to help rescue an individual from their flaws.
