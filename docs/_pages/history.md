# History of the RPG Squire

## The Beginnings....
RPG Squire started out in the beginning of 2019 as a small application that Ken Moore started writing up for himself and some of his friends while they played a game of Pathfinder. This original application was written in C++/Qt5, and was originally called "a glorified calculator". It was an experiment in a dynamic calculation system that utilized JSON-formatted text to determine how to reference items and perform calculations. Over the course of the next year, it continued to evolve and change. A way to write up compaign logs. Then a way to dynamically keep track of items, how many uses a skill had remaining. A way to automatically make changes to stats and skill when an item was equipped or unequipped. Dice rollers, icons for skills and items, and all sorts of other visual elements. Then the big issue.... while Ken could make items and abilities really easily, how could he easily send those to his friends? At the moment, the only way to make it work for them was for them to bring their laptops over to Ken to update the app and add items as needed. He created a public GitHub repository in September of 2019 to host the JSON items in a loose "database" that he could easily have his friends pull new items and changes from. This helped solve the distribution of items, but a new issue quickly arose... How to get the app on all his friends' computers? He was using a Linux laptop for developing, one friend had a Mac (which he got the app working on, with great difficulty). The friend with a netbook was completely out of luck.

In the beginning of 2020, Ken began to experiment with newer types of applications, specifically, Ken started working a lot more with the "go" programming language and putting together websites using various frameworks.
