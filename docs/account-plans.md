## Hire the Squire!
By sponsoring Ken Moore via GitHub Sponsors, you will gain access to expanded resources within the RPG Squire application.

**Definition of Terms:**

* *Character Slots:* This is the maximum number of player characters that you can save under your account. Characters may be deleted in order to free up slots as necessary. Every character may be used to play in games hosted by other user accounts.
* *Game Slots:* This is the maximum number of games that you can create and run as a Game Master (GM).
* *Players per Game:* This is the maximum number of player characters that can be associated with games that you run as the GM.
   * Note: The "Free" account below has a Players per Game limit of 0 with one game slot. This means that you can create a game and try out the GM interface, but cannot actually invite players to your game until you upgrade to one of the other account types.
